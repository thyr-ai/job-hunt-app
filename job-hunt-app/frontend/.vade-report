# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the Job Hunt App frontend (Vite + React application).

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` package to the project
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with dependency resolution

### 2. Modified Files
- **src/App.jsx**
  - Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react'`
  - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component at the end of the main dashboard div, just before the closing tag
  - This placement ensures Speed Insights tracks all pages and interactions within the app

## Implementation Details

Since this is a Vite + React application (not Next.js), I followed the React implementation guidelines:
- Used the `@vercel/speed-insights/react` package import
- Added the `<SpeedInsights />` component to the main App component
- The component is placed at the root level to ensure it tracks performance across all routes

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ **Package Installation**: Successfully installed `@vercel/speed-insights` via npm
2. ✅ **Build Verification**: Ran `npm run build` - build completed successfully without errors
3. ✅ **Code Integration**: SpeedInsights component properly integrated into App.jsx

## Next Steps for Deployment

To complete the Speed Insights setup:
1. Deploy the application to Vercel
2. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Speed Insights tab → Enable)
3. After deployment, verify the tracking script at `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js`
4. Wait for traffic to view metrics in the Vercel dashboard

## Technical Notes

- The Speed Insights component will automatically detect the Vercel environment and only activate when deployed
- In local development, the component is present but won't send data
- No additional configuration is needed - the component works out of the box
